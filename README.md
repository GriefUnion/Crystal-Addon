Crystal Addon is a Minecraft addon designed for Meteor Client, compatible with the latest version of minecraft. It is intended for exploring and identifying exploits, as well as learning about their usage.

# How-to

## Build:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt in the directory for Crystal Addon.
2. Run the following commands in order:
    ```shell
    ./gradlew clean
    ./gradlew genSources
    ./gradlew build
    ```

## FAQ:

* What Meteor version is the mod for?
    * The latest meteor snapshot. Likely to work for older ones.
* Why does the game crash when I run the .dupereal command?
    * It's intended as a joke command.
* What Minecraft version is this for?
    * We target the latest version of minecraft but always try to support older versions if no big changes were made.
* Why do I get issues while building?
    * Feel free to make an issue report either in our discord server or on the GitHub issues tab.
